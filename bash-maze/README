Oh No! You've wandered into the Bash-Maze!
You must find the chest containing the exit-scroll to get out!
To look around type ls
You should see a list of directions you can go like this:
east north south west
To move use the cd command as in 'cd north'
If you see no directions when you type ls, then it's a dead end
To move backward a level type cd ..
If you find something that is not a direction, like 'chest',
open it by typing bash chest
Good Luck!

Tips:
- Keep track of where you are using the path displayed on the command prompt.
  Looks something like this 'bash-maze/north/west'
- Use tab auto-completion! If you start to type a command as in 'cd n'
  then hit 'tab', if there is a 'north' it will type the rest for you! 
- Watch out for traps!
- Read the main README to learn more about bash and how to make your own maze!
